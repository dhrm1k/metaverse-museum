## ✅ What We Built

- A fully interactive **Metaverse Museum** using **Three.js**
- A digital environment where users can **walk through galleries** and **experience art**
- Removes physical limitations—no need to visit a museum in person
- Accessible from anywhere with just an internet connection

## 🎯 Why We Built It

- We wanted to make **art more inclusive and accessible**

- More than paintings or sculptures
- It’s about **patience**, **observation**, and **perspective**
- It teaches us to slow down and appreciate the beauty in life
