# Metaverse Museum

Hey everyone!

Last weekend, we had an amazing time at **HackNuthon 6.0** at **Nirma University**.  
We’re super excited to share that our team made it to the **Top 10** in the Open Innovation track and yes, we even got some cool goodies! 🎁

## What We Made

We built a **Metaverse Museum**—a 3D interactive museum using **Three.js**.

- You can walk around like you're in a real gallery
- Explore art and music digitally
- No need to travel or buy tickets just open it on your browser
- It works for anyone, anywhere

## Why We Made This

Let’s be honest—most of us don’t visit museums that often.  
Art sometimes feels far away or something only “experts” get.

We wanted to change that.

We believe art should be for everyone. So we made a museum that’s free, online, and super easy to explore.

##  What Art Means to Us

Art isn’t just about paintings or music.  
It’s about **looking closely**, **thinking differently**, and **feeling something new**.

It helps you pause and see beauty in everyday life.

## What We Hope

We hope this museum gets more people curious about creativity.  
Whether you're from a big city or a small town, we want you to experience art—no limits.

## Tech We Used

- `Three.js` for the 3D world
- Basic web stuff like `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
